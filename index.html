 <h1>Saloni Robinson</h1> 
 <h2> Lessons, tests and work in progress portfolio</h2>
 <p>Welcome to my website! Sal Learns to Code originally started as a test so that I could learn how to deploy a website. Since then I have used this website as a place to test the skills I have been learning. You can click on the 'Posts' link on the top right to see a rundown and epxplantion of lessons I've had.</p>
 <p>I have been thinking about my career development recently and front-end web development is something I really want to pursue. That said, I would also like to learn back-end web development too but learning takes time! I want to master my craft so whilst I've got a live website I have decided to use it as a portfolio to showcase the projects I have been working on. If you click on the 'Test Project' link also on the top right, you'll be able to see what I've been working on!
<p>My details are below, so please get in touch and feel free to explore my social media profiles.
