		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I've been learning html and css over the last few months. I have currently been learning JavaScript fundamentals, I'd quite like to apply what I have learnt into my own project.</p>
		<p>In truth, I am really enjoying what I've been learning so far and would love to purse a career in coding but I need to begin applying what I've been learning into a project.</p>
		<p>And so, this website will be the start of my musings and it will slowly develop from a simple website to a much more evolved version as I keep learning skills to make the website look and function better.</p>
