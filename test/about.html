		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I've been learning html and css over the last few months and before I feel ready to move onto the next level &#40i.e javascript&#41, I'd quite like to apply what I have learnt into my own project.</p>
		<p>In truth, I am really enjoying what I've been learning so far and would love to purse a career in coding but I need to begin applying what I've been learning to a project.</p>
		<p>And so, this website will be the start of my musings and it will slowly develop from a simple website to a much more evolved version as I keep learning skills to make the website look better.</p>
