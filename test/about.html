		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I've been learning html and css over the last few months. I have recently been learning JavaScript fundamentals and I hope to showcase these skills in my own projects to grow my portfolio.</p>
		
		<p>This website will be a platform of what I have been learning and it will slowly develop from a simple website to a much more evolved version as I keep learning skills to make the website look and function better.</p>
