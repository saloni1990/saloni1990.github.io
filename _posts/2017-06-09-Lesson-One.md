	<h1>Lesson 1: HTML Basics</h1>
		    <p>HTML is fundamental in learning how to code. I seem to have a good understanding of this and would like to learn CSS.</p>
		  <h2>Resources</h2>
	    	<p>I been using a variety of resources to find out a bit more about frontend and back-end web development, such as DASH from General Assembly, Codecademy and the Odin Project</p>
	    	<h3>Codecademy - HTML Basics</h3> 
		 <p>I am pretty comfortable with HTML (or so I think!) but I thought I'd go right back down to basics to really get to grips with this whole process. Codecademy's lessons are pretty flexible so I can create my own content which means what you are reading now is part of my learning process.</p>
		<h4>Creating my first blog post</h4>
		<p> Since I launched my website, which is supported by Jekyll, I thought I'd made my own blog post using the code I am creating in HTML Basics of Codecademy. I thought it was super simply to start a new blog post but it's not as simply as Wordpress. I looked through all the Jekyll files and realised that the style and layout is automatically applied to the overall design of the post. It seems creating a blog post wasn't as easy as I had originally thought and after several Google searches and Jekyll forums I found out how create very first blog post.</p> 
		<h5>Test Layout</h5>
		<p>This lessons covers all the different types of headings which is why this post looks a little strange.</p>
		<h6>Come back soon to see my progress!</h6>
		<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
