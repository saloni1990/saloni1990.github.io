    <h1>Hexadecimal Values
    </h1>
    <p>Up until now, when choosing colours I have been using words such as "red", "green" and "blue". What I wanted to use other colours, such as crimson red or a colour as orange as a sunset? CSS doesnt understand language like that but it can understand millions of colours in the form of hexadecimal values.
    </p>
    <p>We're already familiar with demical values as it's in every day counting. When we see a number (e.g. 1,543), each digit can only go from 0 - 9. Because there are only ten possibilities, we say that regular counting is base-10. Hexadecimal counting is base-16. Each digit can be the numbers 0 through 9 or the letters a through f!

    <p>Here is an example
    </p>
    <h1>I'm maroon!</h1>
		<h2>I'm coral!</h2>
		<h3>I'm goldenrod!</h3>
		<h4>I'm sea green!</h4>
		<h5>I'm royal blue!</h5>
		<h6>I'm plum!</h6>
