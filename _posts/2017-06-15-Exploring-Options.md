     <p>In my earlier post I mentioned that I am using a range of sources to learn how to code. </p>
     <p>The first ever place where I learnt what coding means and how it works was on General Assembly by using the DASH tool to create a demo website. As I had registered with them, I often than not get various newsletters from them about blogs, news and upcoming workshops. 
     <a href"https://generalassemb.ly/education/the-psychology-of-entrepreneurship">"The Psychology of Entrepreneurship"</a> workshop really stood out with so I went along with a friend to General Academy's HQ to listen to the talk. My friend and I have been discussing for a long time about where we want to take our careers, so this was the first step!</p>
     <p>The session was about the type of personality it took to become a successful Entrepreneur and whilst it was insightful to listen to someone talk about traits that needed to build a thriving start-up, I believe that if anyone has the right attitude and they want something enough then that's enough.</p>
