         	<h2>Indentation, a tip to remember</h2>
       		<p>Indentation is the amount each line is spaced in from the margin. When placing tags inside of other tags, we indent them more. This really helps make code more readable! It is important to follow the indentation style like in <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/web-beginner-en-y2Yjd/0/2?curriculum_id=50579fb998b470000202dc8b" target="_blank">this example</a> when writing HTML so it is less confusing.</p>
