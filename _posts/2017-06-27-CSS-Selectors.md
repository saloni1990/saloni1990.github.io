<h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
<p>I've learnt that all HTML elements are able to become CSS selectors.</p>
<p>This also applies to the whole body of the HTML.  </p>
<h1>Multiple Selectors<h1>
<p>I am able to nest HTML elements inside one another and I wanted to grab the p's that are inside two div's instead of all the p's. I think the example below from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-WF0CF/0/2?curriculum_id=50579fb998b470000202dc8b">Codecademy</a> is a really good example</p>

<h1>One selector to rule them all</h1>
<p>The * selector applies CSS styling to every element on the page for example, if I were to use the * selector with a 2px border, there will be a border around <em>every</em> element on the html page like the example below</p>
