	    <h1>Using links</h1>
	    <p>Codecademy's next lessson involves linking pages to another part of my website but instead I'm going make this post to link to Codecademy's website to show a range of courses that someone teaching themselvs the necessary skills can learn.</p>

	    <h1>Inserting Images</h1>
	    <p>By using the src attrbibute with the image tag you are telling that tag where to find the image. The classic example given by Codecademy is this:
	    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-blog/assets/f3a16fb6.jpg" />
