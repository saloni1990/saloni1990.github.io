        <li>Favourite Quotes
            <ol>
             <li>“Life is both sad and solemn. We are led into a wonderful world, we meet one another here, greet each other - and wander together for a brief moment. Then we lose each other and disappear as suddenly and unreasonably as we arrived.” 
― Jostein Gaarder, Sophie's World</li>
             <li>“Fear is the engine that drives the human animal. Humanity sees the world as a place of uncountable threats, and so the world becomes what humanity imagines it to be. They not only live in fear but use fear to control one another. Fearmongering is their true religion.” 
― Dean Koontz, 77 Shadow Street</li>
             <li>“There are no facts, only interpretations.” 
― Friedrich Nietzsche</li>
