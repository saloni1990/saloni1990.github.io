<h1>Intro to Node</h1>

<h2>What is node?</h2>
<p>Up until a few years ago, all JavaScript commands had to be executed in the browser. Which mean that all JavaScript code was frontend and we couldn't run JavaScript on the server side. Node Js is a way for us to write JavaScript on the server side.</p>
<p>Node is popular amongst existing Developers. It has great libraries and its high-performance and it's in JavaScript</p>

<h2>What is npm?</h2>
<p>It is the package manager for JavaScript, it stands for node package manager. WHen we write frontend JavaScript we need to use a script tag in our HTML. If we wanted to use javaScript on the server side how can we include a script tag without any HTML? The way we can get JAvaScript libraries on the server side is through npm. Rather than calling them libraries, npm refers to them as packages. Packages are just code that someone else has written that we can include and add to our own project.</p>
