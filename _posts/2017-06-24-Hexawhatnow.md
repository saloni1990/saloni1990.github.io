    <h1>Hexadecimal Values</h1>
    <p>Up until now, when choosing colours I have been using words such as "red", "green" and "blue". What I wanted to use other colours, such as crimson red or a colour as orange as a sunset? CSS doesnt understand language like that but it can understand millions of colours in the form of hexadecimal values.</p>
    <p>We're already familiar with demical values as it's in every day counting. When we see a number (e.g. 1,543), each digit can only go from 0 - 9. Because there are only ten possibilities, we say that regular counting is base-10. Hexadecimal counting is base-16. Each digit can be the numbers 0 through 9 or the letters a through f!</p>
    <p>WHex values always start with a pound sign (#), are up to six "digits" long, and are not case-sensitive. #FFC125 and #ffc125 are the same color.</p>
    <p>Here is an example:</p>
    <h1>I'm maroon!</h1>
    <h2>I'm coral!</h2>
    <h3>I'm goldenrod!</h3>
    <h4>I'm sea green!</h4>
    <h5>I'm royal blue!</h5>
    <h6>I'm plum!</h6>
    <p>There are many online tools that can help you choose the right colour from a hex pallette. Here are some of the best one I have found.</p>

    <p>There's also some great articles that explain how colour theory works so that your website can be attractive to your audience. It's extremely helpful to understand this and the meaning behind the value of the code when choosing your hex values, especially if you are a beginner, like me!</p>
