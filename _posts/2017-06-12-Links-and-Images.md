	    <h1>Using links</h1>
	  	  <p>Codecademy's next lessson involves linking pages to another part of my website but instead I'm going to make this post link to Codecademy's website to show you a range of courses that are available to beginners learning to code.</p>
	    <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/" target="_blank">Codecademy - Web Beginner</a>
	   <h1>Inserting Images</h1>
	    <p>By using the src attrbibute with the image tag you are telling that tag where to find the image. The classic example given by Codecademy is this:<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-blog/assets/f3a16fb6.jpg" /></p>
	    <p>I'm not really a fan of the image or the style of how the image is displayed next to the text so I'm going to add my own image with some HTML styling of my own so that the image is aligned to the text. I have learnt this by reading <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Sites/1118008189" target="_blank">HTML &amp; CSS: Design and Build Websites</a> by Jon Ducket.</p>

This one of the of the posters released by HBO. Credit to <a href="www.winteriscoming.net" target="_blank">WinterIsComing.net</a></p>
