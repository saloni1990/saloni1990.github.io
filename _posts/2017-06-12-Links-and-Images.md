	    <h1>Using links</h1>
	    <p>Codecademy's next lessson involves linking pages to another part of my website but instead I'm going make this post to link to Codecademy's website to show a range of courses that someone teaching themselvs the necessary skills can learn.</p>
	    <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/">Codecademy - Web Beginner</a>
	    <h1>Inserting Images</h1>
	    <p>By using the src attrbibute with the image tag you are telling that tag where to find the image. The classic example given by Codecademy is this:
	    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-blog/assets/f3a16fb6.jpg" /></p>
	    <p>I'm not really a fan of the image or the style of how the image is displayed so I'm going to add my own image with some HTML styling of my own which I have learnt through <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Sites/1118008189">HTML &amp; CSS: Design and Build Websites</a> by Jon Ducket.</p>
	    <p><img src="http://winteriscoming.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/385/files/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-23-at-1.10.55-PM.jpg" alt="GOT S7" width="200" height="350" align="right" /> So a bit of insight into my interests, I'm currently re-watching Games of Thones in time for season 7 launch in July and this one of the of the posters released by HBO</p>
