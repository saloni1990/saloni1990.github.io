		<p>Finally! I am at a stage where I can properly learn CSS. This excitement may actually show how naiive I am being as the learning will start to get complicated from now.</p>
    <p>CSS (which stands for <strong>C</strong>ascading <strong>S</strong>tyle <strong>S</strong>heets) is a language used to describe the appearance and formatting of your HTML.</p>
    <p>A style sheet is a file that describes how an HTML file should look. That's it!</p>
    </p>We say these style sheets are cascading because the sheets can apply formatting when more than one style applies. For instance, if you say all paragraphs should have blue font, but you specifically single out one paragraph to have red font, CSS can do that!</p>
    <p>There are two ways to put CSS in one place. This first is to put your CSS between <style></style> tags, right in the same file as your HTML. These <style> tags go inside the <head></head> of your webpage; check out the example in the editor to the right.
