    <h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
    <p>Now I know a stylesheet is supposed to be on a different file but as I am using Jekyll with it's own predefined stylesheet (and as I am not familiar with what I can edit), I am going to add the style to the HTML document. Once I get the hang of things I'll start to play around with the Jekyll layouts</p>
   <p>So for now I am going to continue to learn the basics of CSS. I think this picture is a perfect example of how CCS works and what each tag or attribute means.
