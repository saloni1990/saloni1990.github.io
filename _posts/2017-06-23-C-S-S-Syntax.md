    <h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
    <p>Now I know a stylesheet is supposed to be on a different file but as I am using Jekyll with it's own predefined stylesheet (and as I am not familiar with what I can edit), I am going to add the style to the HTML document. Once I get the hang of things I'll start to play around with the <span>Jekyll</span> layouts</p>
   <p>So for now I am going to continue to learn the basics of <span>CSS</span>. I think this picture is a perfect example of how <span>CCS</span> works and what each tag or attribute means.</p>

   <h1>Using the Right Comments</h1>
   <p>It is important to differentiate the type of comments you are using when trying HTML and when writing CSS so that the comments can explain to someone why that code has been writing, and it can also help you remind why you have done what you have done! The computer won't look at these comments when it tries to figure out what the HTML and CSS code should do, but you it is worth keeping this good pratice right from the beginning</p>
   <h3>HTML Comments</h3>
   <p>HTML comments look like this: "!--I'm a comment!--" (of course, dont forget to add the tags are either end)
</p>
   <h3>CSS Comments</h3>
 Â  <p>CSS comments, on the other hand, look like this: "/*I'm a comment!*"/</p>
