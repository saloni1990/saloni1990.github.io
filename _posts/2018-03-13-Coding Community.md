<p>About a month ago I joined a couple of groups of Facebook as I felt like there was no-one else to talk to or share the experiences I was going through. So I joined 'Learning to Code' and freeCodeCamp Earth. I was excited and nervous at the same time - I felt like a new door opened where there were so many people in the same position as me, learning to code, but the worrier in me was thinking: 'arghh everyone knows so much more than me!'. It is quite overwhelming to see other people working on more advanced stuff than you but what I've got to remember is that they were in my position at some point</p>

<p>I hadn't shared anything in the groups, I was mostly just reading other people's comments and their experiences, up until last night... </p>

<p>I was preparing Sal Learns to Code to share with a recruiter and thought 'Well, if I am sharing this with a recruiter, then what's stopping me from sharing this with other people?'. I wanted to get feedback from people but was worried about what kind of comments I would get. I haven't really shown the website to anyone other than the other half and whilst he is super enthusiastic about what I am doing, he doesnt really understand the technicalities. I decided to share my website on 'Learning to Code' and if thought that if a get any negative feedback then I can take it as constructive criticism and make my website better.</p>

<p>I spent a while making sure my code was relatively tidy and trying to fix a couple of issues. See for me, the thing I enjoy about front-end web development is that you can see the outputs of your work and if something doesn't work, there's always a solution to fix it, you just have to assess what you have done. There is also a huge community of people who are willing to help if you are stuck, but chances are that if you are stuck on something, someone else has had the same problem and there's probably an answer for it already.</p>

<p>Eventually I posted my link and watched Google Analytics to if anyone was actually going to take the time to look at teh website. I waited and waited and for a while (in the first minute!) there was nothing. Then my Google Analytics starting changing.. 1, 2, 3 people looking at the site, and the number kept going up!</p>

<p>It gave me such a buzz knowing that people were looking at my website and then the comments started coming in... there was such positive feedback and suggestions on how to make my website better. I've collected some of the comments, mostly for me to look back on.</p>
