<h1>What is a framework? How is it different from a library?</h1>

<p>Up until now we have been using libraries such as jQuery and Bootstrap and some would also say that npm packages can also be libraries. So far, the definition of libraries is code someone else has wrote that we can add to our application and use. Frameworks are similar, they are code that someone else has wrote that we can use inside of our appliation but the way we use them is different. The article below sums up the difference between a library and framework well:

<p>The most important difference, and in fact the defining difference between a library and a framework is Inversion of Control. It means that when you control a library <em>you</em> are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the <em>framework</em>call you.</p>
	<p>With frameworks all of the control flow is already in the framework, and there's just a bunch of predefined white spots that you can fill out with your code. A library on the other hand is a collection of functionality that <em>you</em> can call.</p>

<p>Frameworks take all the common things we do in an application and pre-packages it all up.</p>
<h1>What is Express?</h1>

<p>There are many frameworks out there, for example they can help to make video games and mobile apps. There are also many frameworks to help build web applications and Express is one of them.</p>

<h1>Why are we using Express?</h1>

<p>To build the apps in the Web Developer Bootcamp, we will be using Express. Express is the most popular node development framework. Express is a light-weight framework where you know exactly where you're getting.

<h1>Routes</h1>
<p>Routes are important because it is how it listens to requests then runs some other code depending on the request we get.  </p>

<h1>Package.json</h1>
<p>It stands for JavaScript Object Notification and it is a datatype, it is a way of formatting text in a file to represent structure. It contains all the metadata about the express package</p>
